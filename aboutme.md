I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, working in the intersection between machine learning and robotics. My deeply
seeded belief is that these technologies have the potential to change the world for the better, and my mission is to
bring intelligent star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality (minus the blasters).

### Education
I graduated **MSc AI & Robotics** at the University of Edinburgh in 2020 where I did my disseration on
**Adaptive Motion Control for Autonomous Racing** with [Michael Mistry](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/academics/michael-mistry). Throughout my time in Edinburgh, I also established the [driverless branch of Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS)](/2020-06-19-formula-student/) where we build autonomous racecars.

### Work Experience
- I worked as an **Applied Scientist** at Oxbottica, working on a data-driven edge case discovery system for AVs, called [MetaDriver](https://www.oxbotica.com/insight/oxbotica-metadriver-uses-metaverse-to-detect-rare-and-unusual-scenarios-1000-times-faster-than-actual-driving/). I got to work with stellar people on cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning at a massive scale.
- I worked as a **Robotics Engineer** at Kopernikus Automotive, working on path planning and control for autonomated valet parking. We worked pretty close to production and I led a [nice demo at an IAA confernece](/2021-10-01-iaa)

### Talks
- [Weekly Robotics Meetup #2 - Robocars](https://youtu.be/nNWgXSi-lds)
- How AI is enabling autonomous driving @ DEV.BG


### Skills
Nowadays I mostly use Python + PyTorch, but I also still occasionally dabble with C/C++, Rust, and ROS. Through the years, I've also gotten pretty good at team working, management, leadership and the all-important communcation skill.
