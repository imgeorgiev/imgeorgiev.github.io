  <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
    Hey! I'm Ignat, a Robotics and ML researcher.
    I am currently doing a PhD at Georgia Tech, working with <a href="https://animesh.garg.tech/">Animesh Garg</a>. My
    deeply
    seeded belief is that robotics and learning have the potential to change the world for the better, and my mission is
    to
    bring intelligent star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality (minus the blasters).

    I also used to work for 2 years as an ML engineer/researcher in autonomous vehicles.
    Nowadays I occasionally do some consulting or contracting work on projects I find interesting.
    Shoot me an <a href="mailto: ignat@imgeorgiev.com">email</a> if you have something in mind!

    This little website is my space to tell the world <strong><a href="/aboutme">about me</a></strong>,
    put <strong><a href="/files/ignat_georgiev_resume.pdf">my resume</a></strong> out there, show off my
    <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> and spread some wisdom about Robotics and Machine Learning.
    I occasionally blog about things I'm researching with a focus on understanding the underlying theory and math.
