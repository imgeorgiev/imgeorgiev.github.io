  <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
    I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, working in the intersection between machine learning and robotics. My deeply
    seeded belief is that these technologies have the potential to change the world for the better, and my mission is to
    bring intelligent star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality (minus the blasters). I occasionally blog about
    things I'm researching with a focus on understanding the underlying theory and math.
