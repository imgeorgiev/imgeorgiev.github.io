  <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
    I am a young, enthusiastic, and highly driven <strong>roboticist and entrepreneur</strong>
    with a passion for everything <strong>robotics and AI</strong>. My deeply seeded belief is
    that these technologies have the potential to drastically improve our lives
    and my mission is to bring star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality.
