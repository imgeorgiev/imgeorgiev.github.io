<div id="aboutme-section">
  <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
    I am a roboticist, software research engineer, and entrepreneur passionate about robotics and machine learning. My deeply seeded belief is that these technologies have the potential to change the world for the better, and my mission is to bring intelligent star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality (minus the blasters).

    This little website is my space to tell the world <strong><a href="/aboutme">about me</a></strong>,
    put <strong><a href="/files/ignat_georgiev_resume.pdf">my resume</a></strong> out there, show off my
    <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> and spread some wisdom about robotics and AI.
