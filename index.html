  <p>
    Hey! I'm Ignat, a Robotics and ML researcher.
    I am currently doing a PhD at Georgia Tech, working with
    <strong><a href="https://animesh.garg.tech/">Animesh Garg</a></strong>.
    My deeply seeded belief is that robotics and learning have the potential to change the world for the better, and my
    mission is to bring intelligent star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality (minus the blasters).
  </p>

  <p>
    I also used to work for 2 years as an ML engineer/researcher in autonomous vehicles.
    Nowadays I occasionally do some consulting or contracting work on projects I find interesting.
    <strong><a href="mailto: ignat@imgeorgiev.com">Shoot me an email</a></strong> if you have something in mind!

    This little website is my space to tell the world <strong><a href="/aboutme">about me</a></strong>,
    put <strong><a href="/files/ignat_georgiev_resume.pdf">my resume</a></strong> out there, show off my
    <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> and spread some wisdom about Robotics and Machine Learning.
    I occasionally blog about things I'm researching with a focus on understanding the underlying theory and math.
