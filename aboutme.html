    Hi, I am Ignat, a young, enthusiastic, and highly driven <strong>roboticist and entrepreneur</strong>
    with a passion for everything <strong>robotics and AI</strong>. My deeply seeded belief is
    that these technologies have the potential to drastically improve our lives
    and my mission is to bring star-wars-like robots one step closer to reality.

    I have graduated <strong>MSc Robotics & AI</strong> at the University of Edinburgh in 2020.
    I have done my 2-year dissertation on <b>Adaptive Motion Control for Autonomous Racing</b>
  </p>

    <span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
    Most recently I <b>worked as a Robotics Engineer</b> at Kopernikus Automotive <b>developing
      an autonomous valet parking solution</b> that will hit production cars soon! I was involved
    mostly in path planning and motion control and a bit of environment modelling and simulation.
    My <b>previous job experience</b> includes working at <b>Roborace</b> on developing a reference
    <b>autonomous driving software stack</b>.
    For 2 summers I have also interned at Indie Semiconductor where I have worked on <b>firmware
      development</b> for custom microcontrollers for <b>IoT and automotive applications</b>. Also I
    have worked as a Digital Skills tutor at my university <b>teaching people coding with Python</b>.

    <span class="fa fa-book about-icon"></span>
    I have published a reserach paper on learning vehicle dynamics online which you
    can read more about in its <a href="http://www.imgeorgiev.com/2020-09-20-first-paper/">blog post</a>.

    I've given some talks through my life:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/nNWgXSi-lds">Weekly Robotics Meetup #2 - Robocars</a></li>
    <li>How AI is enabling autonomous driving @ DEV.BG</li>
  </ul>

    My technical skills include C/C++, Rust, Python, ROS, CUDA, PyTorch, Tensorfow,
    Version Control (i.e. git), CI & CD, Operating Systems, Distributed computing,
    Parallel computing and robotics simulators. Through time, I've also gotten good at
    team working, management, leadership and the all-important communcation skill.

    Originally, from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razgrad">Razgrad, Bulgaria</a></i>, I have always been
    fascinated by
    how computers have impacted our world. After high school, I moved to the beautiful city
    of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh, UK</a></i> to pursue better education (and wet
    weather apparently).
    At some point throughout University, I got intrigued by robotics and are now focusing extensively on that field.

    In my free time I entertain myself by building and flying racing quadcopters for pure fun and adrenaline.
    When I have more free time on my hands I enjoy travelling through the world on motorbike.

  I also enjoy hiking, bouldering, playing video games and doing some
